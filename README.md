## üìù Project Description
With the Steam-Client from Valve Corporation and installed games from countless developers, a lot of files are installed on the hard drives of users who monitore, write and upload (personal) data without user permission. This includes telemetry and analytics, user profiling, crash analytics and more.

Since many things are automatically allowed by firewall systems, users need to be especially careful before launching the client and/or their games.

Especially with large libraries, it would be pointless to manually scan each installation folder for spyware. Therefore I wrote a small batch file that does the job and cleans the Steam and game directories.

### Special features:
- Option to delete common spyware and crashlytics from Unity Technologies, ApS, Microsoft Corporation, Google LLC, Avalanche Studios, Epic Games, Inc. and many more
- Option to clean your Steam folders (Library Cache, Picture, Download and Shadercache)
- Option to clean your Steam HTML Cache

## üìñ Installation
Copy the file del_u3a_en.bat into your Steam installation folder and/or additional library folder and run the file. In the library folders, steam.cfg is not necessary and can be deleted.
Remove the Steam.cfg in the installation directory of Steam itself only for client updates or files will reloaded again for each start.

If new games with the same services are installed after deleting the existing spyware files and crashlytics, the batch can be run again to remove these files as well.

### Filenames:

German:
- del_u3a_de.bat
- readme_DE.txt

English:
- del_u3a_en.bat
- readme_EN.txt
