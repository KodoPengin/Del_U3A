--------------------------

Installation:

Copy the file del_u3a_en.bat into your Steam installation folder and/or additional library folder and run the file

--------------------------

Description:

The batch scans files within the steam folder for crashlytics and logs and deletes associated files.
Additionally the CrashDump folder (if available) in the user directory is emptied.

This prevents a secret data mining and sending of Crashlytics by companies like Unity Technologies, ApS, Epic Games, Inc.
or the Valve Corporations and increases the own privacy during the own game sessions.

The script will be extended as needed.

The batch creates a "steam.cfg". This file prevents the automatic update of the Steam client.
This is necessary, because otherwise Steam downloads and overwrites files every time it is started.
Users who use their own layout modifications for Steam probably know this procedure. 

--------------------------

hosts:

The hosts file is used for our purpose as protection against outbound traffic and sending our data.
The batch (Point 5) in this file is used to block some analytics of the company Unity Technologies
and crashlytics of Valve Corporation and Avalanche Studios.

hosts folder: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

The batch inserts the following entries once (if they do not exist):
