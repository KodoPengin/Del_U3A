----------------- 1. Description -----------------

The windows-batch-file scans files within the steam folder for crashlytics and logs and deletes associated files.
Additionally the CrashDump and Unity Analytics folder (if available) in the user directory are emptied.

This prevents a secret data mining and sending of Crashlytics by companies like Unity Technologies, ApS, Epic Games, Inc.
or the Valve Corporations and increases the own privacy during the own game sessions.

The script will be extended as needed.

The batch creates a "steam.cfg". This file prevents the automatic update of the Steam client.
This is necessary, because otherwise Steam downloads and overwrites files every time it is started.
Users who use their own layout modifications for Steam probably know this procedure. 



----------------- 2. Installation & execution -----------------

Copy the file del_u3a_en.bat into your Steam installation folder and/or additional library folder and run the file. In the library folders, steam.cfg is not necessary and can be deleted.
Remove the Steam.cfg in the installation directory of Steam itself only for client updates.

If new games with the same services are installed after deleting the existing spyware files and crashlytics, the batch can be run again to remove these files as well.


----------------- 3. Deleted files -----------------

----------------- 5. Problems -----------------

The files Unity.MemoryProfiler.dll, UnityEngine.CrashReportingModule.dll, UnityEngine.PerformanceReportingModule.dll, UnityEngine.UnityConnectModule.dll and UnityEngine.UnityTestProtocolModule.dll have been deactivated from the list of deleted files, because it differs depending on the product whether after removing the files the game itself still works or not. If you want, you can still test this out yourself.

There is currently no better solution. UnityCrashhandler can be removed from your system without hesitation.

For GameCrashUploader.exe it is sufficient to delete the file and create a text file named GameCrashUploader in the same directory and save it as exe. The file then has 0kb size and the product still runs.
Since the file size is not checked, it is thus sufficient to fool the respective game (New World).
